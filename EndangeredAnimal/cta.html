                <section>
                    <p>As moral human beings, we can get involved in saving the Amur tiger species in many ways. We can fight to end logging in the Siberian forests. This logging is killing the available prey for the tigers as well as some of the tigers themselves.</p>
                    
                    <p>We can also fight illegal poaching. Amur tigers are hunted for their beautiful pelts. They are skinned, and the skin and fur are preserved and used as decorations for homes and offices. They are also hunted for medicinal properties the Chinese cultures believe they have because of their immense strength and size.</p>
                    
                    <p>We can push for better laws protecting the tigers and the habitats themselves. These laws can be things like protection of the tigers by watching the black market for parts of the animal. We can also push for laws protecting the habitat to prevent logging and other forms of deforestation.</p>
