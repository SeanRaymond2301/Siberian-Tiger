                        <p>The Alta Conservation Foundation is a wildlife protection foundation that has fundraisers to support the Amur tiger.

                        <p>The World Wildlife Fund supports the Amur tiger in the Amur-Heliong landscape by monitoring their population. They also prevent habitat loss and illegal poaching. They push for harsher anti-poaching and anti-deforestation laws in congress, and increase the prey the tigers have access to. They also provide a lot of information about the tiger itself, why it is poached, and why deforestation harms them. They spend a lot of time in their site raising the public’s awareness of the Amur tiger’s threats. They want the public to get involved physically as well as monitarily. </p>
