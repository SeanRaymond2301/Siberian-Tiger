                        The Amur tigers are endangered. That means there are very few in the world, in a small part of the world. These tigers have major threats, and their population is declining. In the 1940s’ their population actually dipped down to 40 tigers recorded, which they have recovered. These threats are ultimately after effects of human action, or direct human action.

                        Amur tigers have been hunted by the Chinese people since ancient time. Their body parts are highly sought after by the Chinese because of the ancient medicinal practices. Their strength and prowess has been highly regarded, and the ancient chinese believed that these tigers contained medicinal properties.

                        Another major threat to the Amur tiger population is illegal poaching of the tiger. They are hunted for their pelts, teeth, claws, and other body parts for decoration. They are also hunted for their muscle to be eaten. A single Amur tiger could be divided up and sold on the black market for around $50,000 USD.

                        Another threat, although minor in some ways and major in another is logging. This is a minor threat because it isn’t a large scale destruction of their habitat, but it is destruction of their habitat. With every tree cut down for wood, that is another tree that an animal feeding the prey of an Amur tiger eats that can no longer live there.

                    <p>
                        Altogether, the Amur tiger has many large threats to their population. One of them thankfully is not predators, as they are at the top of the food chain for their community. Although the Amur tiger has been slowly increasing, it is still endangered, and will remain to be and possibly relapse into extinction due to the threats on them. Their growth is beginning to plateau, and will fall back down if we don’t stop the threats now.
